# GI.chat Client 1.0 - Deprecated

GI.chat Client 1.0 is now deprecated. This version relies on Tkinter for the user interface, which offers limited customization compared to GI.chat Client 2.0, which uses PyQt for enhanced flexibility and customization options.

As of now, GI.chat Client 1.0 will no longer receive updates, bug fixes, or new features. It is recommended that you transition to GI.chat Client 2.0 for an improved experience and continued support.
